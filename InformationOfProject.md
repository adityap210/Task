The goal of my project given to me, is to make Task Management Application that allow user to create, update and delete their work.
The application has functionalities like marking tasks as complete or incomplete , delete and edit.

Project Breakdown
Task Management: The first requirement was to manage tasks effectively. I decided to use React for building the UI
State Management: I used React’s useState and useEffect hooks to manage the app's state efficiently. These hooks allowed me to manage tasks, update the task list, and track whether tasks were marked as complete or incomplete.
UI/UX Design: The design was kept simple and responsive. I focused on ensuring that the application would be easy to use across both mobile and desktop screens. 

Key Features
Create, Update, and Delete Tasks:  Users can add new tasks, edit existing tasks, or remove tasks they no longer need. This is handled using simple state management and events.
Mark Tasks as Complete/Incomplete:  The app provides functionality to mark tasks as completed or incomplete, which is reflected in the task’s visual status.
Filtering and Sorting:   Users can filter tasks based on their completion status (All, Completed, Incomplete) and can sort tasks by their creation date or priority. This provides flexibility in how the user views their tasks.
